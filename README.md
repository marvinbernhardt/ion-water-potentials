# Ion-Water Potentials

This repository contains ion-water (ion-oxygen) potentials as they were used in our upcoming publication.
They are given in the [Gromacs table format](https://manual.gromacs.org/current/reference-manual/special/tabulated-interaction-functions.html).
Additionally the AIMD RDF that were used for their parametrization are provided.
